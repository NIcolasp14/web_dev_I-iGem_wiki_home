# web_dev_I-iGem_wiki_home
For my team iGem Athens I built the home page of our website (even though it isn't updated as of now. It was crucial for it to be appealing and eye-catching, while also explaining our message visually and in an elegant way. At first, we can see a neon title trembling, and the ganglia on the MRI on the left also trembling in different intervals. This was done to highlight the damage caused by Parkinson's Disease and our solution at the same time. Moving forward we come across the implementation of our solution, our early PD detection kit. The glass lid opens and we zoom into the middle array of color gradients. When we zoom far enough we can see what lies inside our it: Genetically Engineerd Bacteriophages! They have reacted with the chemical componds in our skin that are related to PD and have changed color, turning into yellow-ish gold! Then, we show the method of diagnosing, by placing the kit on the upper back of the potential patient. Finally, we capture an image of the kit which is analyzed by our app, which contains an advanced image processing pipeline and an advanced deep learning model that extracts the diagnosis! FOr more about the app and its pipelines, go to: softeng_V-SCENTIPD_app, https://github.com/NIcolasp14/softeng_V-SCENTIPD_app.
